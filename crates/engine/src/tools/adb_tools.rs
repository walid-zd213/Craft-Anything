//! A connected Android phone or emulator, through the user's `adb`.
//!
//! Every tool runs `adb` via [`craft_anything_platform::process`] (closed stdin, wall and idle
//! deadlines, capped output, process-group kill on timeout/cancel/drop) and returns an [`Evidence`]
//! record on the authority of an [`Authority::OutsideService`] (the device). Serials, package
//! names, settings keys, intent actions and components are validated against strict allowlists;
//! device paths and extra values are single-quoted before they reach the device shell. Device-paths
//! never become part of a host shell string — adb arguments are passed as argv.
//!
//! Tools that write to the device (`push`, `install`, `uninstall`, `start`, `stop`) carry
//! [`Effects::MUTATES_DEVICE`] and are consent-gated; tools that write to the host carry
//! [`Effects::WRITES_FILESYSTEM`]. When adb isn't installed every tool (except `engines_adb_check`,
//! which reports exactly that) returns a clear `EngineMissing`; when the device is missing or
//! unauthorised they return `NotFound` / `NoPermission`. Nothing ever hangs.
